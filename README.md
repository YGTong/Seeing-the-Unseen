## 🚀 Usage

This section describes the basic workflow for reproducing the main experiments reported in the paper using the released code and publicly available subset of BFDS-2025.


### 1. Environment Setup

We recommend using a virtual environment (e.g., Conda) with Python ≥ 3.8.

```bash
conda create -n tihsnet python=3.8
conda activate tihsnet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### 2. Dataset Preparation

Organize the BFDS-2025 dataset using the following directory structure:

```text
BFDS-2025/
├── train/
│   ├── image_irt/    # Infrared thermal images
│   ├── image_rgb/    # Corresponding RGB images
│   ├── label/        # Annotation files
│   └── mask/         # Pixel-wise segmentation masks
├── val/
│   ├── image_irt/
│   ├── image_rgb/
│   ├── label/
│   └── mask/
└── test/
    ├── image_irt/
    ├── image_rgb/
    ├── label/
    └── mask/
```
Annotation Description

- `mask/`  
  Contains **human-interpretable binary segmentation masks** generated using **LabelMe**.  
  These masks are stored as 2D images and visually indicate delaminated regions, where:
  - Foreground pixels represent defect regions.
  - Background pixels represent non-defective areas.  
  The masks can be directly inspected by human annotators and are used as the primary visual ground truth.

- `label/`  
  Contains **machine-readable label files** derived from the corresponding masks.  
  These labels are generated by converting the binary masks into indexed class maps (e.g., 0 for background, 1 for defect) and are **not visually interpretable by humans**.  
  The `label` files are used as direct inputs to the training and evaluation pipelines for semantic segmentation.

The conversion from `mask` to `label` is performed using a deterministic RGB-to-index mapping, ensuring consistent class encoding across the dataset.



### 3. Experiment Configuration

Before model training and evaluation, key experimental settings can be adjusted by modifying the argument configurations defined in `train.py` and `test.py`.  
These parameters control hardware usage, dataset paths, model architecture, training strategy, and output directories.


#### 3.1 Hardware and Runtime Settings

The following arguments specify GPU usage and parallel data loading behavior:

- `--gpus`  
  GPU device ID(s) used for training and inference.

- `--num-workers`  
  Number of subprocesses used for data loading.


#### 3.2 Dataset and Task Configuration

Dataset location and task-related settings can be configured as follows:

- `--datasetdir`  
  Root directory of the BFDS-2025 dataset.

- `--num-classes`  
  Number of segmentation classes (default: 2 for binary segmentation).

- `--input-size`  
  Input image resolution used for training and inference.


#### 3.3 Training Hyperparameters

Key hyperparameters controlling the training process include:

- `--batch-size`  
  Batch size for model training.

- `--max-epoch`  
  Maximum number of training epochs.

- `--stop-epoch`  
  Epoch at which training is terminated (used for early stopping or controlled training length).

- `--interval-validate`  
  Frequency (in epochs) for validation during training.

- `--lr-model`  
  Learning rate for model optimization.

- `--dropout-rate`  
  Dropout rate used for Monte Carlo Dropout during training and inference.

- `--seed`  
  Random seed to ensure reproducibility.


#### 3.4 Model Selection and Checkpointing

- `--model-name`  
  Specifies the network architecture.  
  Supported options include:  
  **`tihsnet`**, `unet`, `unetplusplus`, `manet`, `linknet`, `fpn`, `pspnet`, `deeplabv3`, `deeplabv3plus`, `pan`, `a2fpn`, `abcnet`, `dinknet34`, `dscnet_pro`, `fasternet`, `newnetrrm`, `segnet`, `transunet`, `segformer-B5`, `u-netformer`.

- `--resume`  
  Path to a checkpoint file for resuming training or performing evaluation.


#### 3.5 Output and Logging Directories

Model outputs and experimental logs are saved according to predefined directory settings:

- In `train.py`, training logs and checkpoints are saved to:
  ```text
  logs_TIHSNet/
  ```
- In `test.py`, evaluation results and visualization are saved to:
  ```text
  results_TIHSNet/mc
  ```


### 4. Model Training

Train the model using the provided training script:

```bash
python train.py
```



### 5. Model Evaluation

Evaluate a trained model on the test set:

```bash
python test.py
```
